# Event Space by DAC
A website where users can find events in an area by putting in a neighborhood or address. It was built using Ruby on Rails, and uses 5 different APIs: the Google Maps API, the Google Mail API, the Ticketmaster API, the NY Art Beat API, and the Eventbrite API.

## Functionality
Users can put in a location (address, neighborhood, or borough), and then they can choose a category for which type of event they want to find. Categories include music, art, or food. They will get a list of events that fit their criteria and can add them to their favorites list. Users can also see the most popular events saved by other users.
